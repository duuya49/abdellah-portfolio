<p>Conducted proactive, hypothesis-driven threat hunting across SIEM data to identify stealthy threats that bypassed automated security controls.</p>

<h3 class="tech-section-title">Execution Steps</h3>
<ul class="step-list">
    <li>Selected high-risk ATT&CK techniques based on the current threat landscape (e.g., Credential Access, Lateral Movement).</li>
    <li>Formulated hunting hypotheses based on specific behaviors and environmental blind spots.</li>
    <li>Developed and executed complex queries across SIEM raw logs to identify anomalies.</li>
    <li>Validated potential findings using secondary telemetry from EDR platforms and email gateways.</li>
    <li>Documented confirmed findings and provided actionable remediation recommendations.</li>
